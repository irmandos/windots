ABOUT_CLASSES_PROPERTIES


Short description

Describes how to define properties for PowerShell classes.


Long description

Properties are members of the class that contain data. Properties are
declared as variables in the class scope. A property can be of any built-in
type or an instance of another class. Classes can zero or more properties.
Classes don't have a maximum property count.

Class properties can have any number of attributes, including the hidden
and static attributes. Every property definition must include a type for
the property. You can define a default value for a property.


Syntax

Class properties use the following syntaxes:

One-line syntax

    [[<attribute>]...] [<property-type>] $<property-name> [= <default-value>]

Multiline syntax

    [[<attribute>]...]
    [<property-type>]
    $<property-name> [= <default-value>]


Examples

Example 1 - Minimal class properties

The properties of the EXAMPLEPROJECT1 class use built-in types without any
attributes or default values.

    class ExampleProject1 {
        [string]   $Name
        [int]      $Size
        [bool]     $Completed
        [string]   $Assignee
        [datetime] $StartDate
        [datetime] $EndDate
        [datetime] $DueDate
    }

    [ExampleProject1]::new()

    $null -eq ([ExampleProject1]::new()).Name

    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

    True

The default value for the NAME and ASSIGNEE properties is $null because
they're typed as strings, which is a reference type. The other properties
have the default value for their defined type, because they're value type
properties. For more information on the default values for properties, see
Default property values.

Example 2 - Class properties with custom types

The properties for EXAMPLEPROJECT2 include a custom enumeration and class
defined in PowerShell before the EXAMPLEPROJECT2 class.

    enum ProjectState {
        NotTriaged
        ReadyForWork
        Committed
        Blocked
        InProgress
        Done
    }

    class ProjectAssignee {
        [string] $DisplayName
        [string] $UserName

        [string] ToString() {
            return "$($this.DisplayName) ($($this.UserName))"
        }
    }

    class ExampleProject2 {
        [string]          $Name
        [int]             $Size
        [ProjectState]    $State
        [ProjectAssignee] $Assignee
        [datetime]        $StartDate
        [datetime]        $EndDate
        [datetime]        $DueDate
    }

    [ExampleProject2]@{
        Name     = 'Class Property Documentation'
        Size     = 8
        State    = 'InProgress'
        Assignee = @{
            DisplayName = 'Mikey Lombardi'
            UserName    = 'michaeltlombardi'
        }
        StartDate = '2023-10-23'
        DueDate   = '2023-10-27'
    }

    Name      : Class Property Documentation
    Size      : 8
    State     : InProgress
    Assignee  : Mikey Lombardi (michaeltlombardi)
    StartDate : 10/23/2023 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 10/27/2023 12:00:00 AM

Example 3 - Class property with a validation attribute

The EXAMPLEPROJECT3 class defines the SIZE property as an integer that must
be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 16. It uses the
VALIDATERANGE attribute to limit the value.

    class ExampleProject3 {
                               [string]   $Name
        [ValidateRange(0, 16)] [int]      $Size
                               [bool]     $Completed
                               [string]   $Assignee
                               [datetime] $StartDate
                               [datetime] $EndDate
                               [datetime] $DueDate
    }

    $project = [ExampleProject3]::new()
    $project

    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

When EXAMPLEPROJECT3 instantiates, the SIZE defaults to 0. Setting the
property to a value within the valid range updates the value.

    $project.Size = 8
    $project

    Name      :
    Size      : 8
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

When SIZE is set to an invalid value outside the range, PowerShell raises
an exception and the value isn't changed.

    $project.Size = 32
    $project.Size = -1

    $project

    SetValueInvocationException:
    Line |
       1 |  $project.Size = 32
         |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         | Exception setting "Size": "The 32 argument is greater than the
         | maximum allowed range of 16. Supply an argument that is less than
         | or equal to 16 and then try the command again."

    SetValueInvocationException:
    Line |
       2 |  $project.Size = -1
         |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         | Exception setting "Size": "The -1 argument is less than the minimum
         | allowed range of 0. Supply an argument that is greater than or
         | equal to 0 and then try the command again."

    Name      :
    Size      : 8
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

Example 4 - Class property with an explicit default value

The EXAMPLEPROJECT4 class defaults the value for the STARTDATE property to
the current date.

    class ExampleProject4 {
        [string]   $Name
        [int]      $Size
        [bool]     $Completed
        [string]   $Assignee
        [datetime] $StartDate = (Get-Date).Date
        [datetime] $EndDate
        [datetime] $DueDate
    }

    [ExampleProject4]::new()

    [ExampleProject4]::new().StartDate -eq (Get-Date).Date

    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 10/23/2023 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

    True

Example 5 - Hidden class property

The GUID property of the EXAMPLEPROJECT5 class has the hidden keyword. The
GUID property doesn't show in the default output for the class or in the
list of properties returned by Get-Member.

    class ExampleProject5 {
               [string]   $Name
               [int]      $Size
               [bool]     $Completed
               [string]   $Assignee
               [datetime] $StartDate
               [datetime] $EndDate
               [datetime] $DueDate
        hidden [string]   $Guid      = (New-Guid).Guid
    }

    $project = [ExampleProject5]::new()

    "Project GUID: $($project.Guid)"

    $project

    $project | Get-Member -MemberType Properties | Format-Table

    Project GUID: c72cef84-057c-4649-8940-13490dcf72f0

    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM


       TypeName: ExampleProject5

    Name      MemberType Definition
    ----      ---------- ----------
    Assignee  Property   string Assignee {get;set;}
    Completed Property   bool Completed {get;set;}
    DueDate   Property   datetime DueDate {get;set;}
    EndDate   Property   datetime EndDate {get;set;}
    Name      Property   string Name {get;set;}
    Size      Property   int Size {get;set;}
    StartDate Property   datetime StartDate {get;set;}

Example 6 - Static class property

The EXAMPLEPROJECT6 class defines the static PROJECTS property as a list of
all created projects. The default constructor for the class adds the new
instance to the list of projects.

    class ExampleProject6 {
               [string]            $Name
               [int]               $Size
               [bool]              $Completed
               [string]            $Assignee
               [datetime]          $StartDate
               [datetime]          $EndDate
               [datetime]          $DueDate
        hidden [string]            $Guid     = (New-Guid).Guid
        static [ExampleProject6[]] $Projects = @()

        ExampleProject6() {
            [ExampleProject6]::Projects += $this
        }
    }

    "Project Count: $([ExampleProject6]::Projects.Count)"

    $project1 = [ExampleProject6]@{ Name = 'Project_1' }
    $project2 = [ExampleProject6]@{ Name = 'Project_2' }

    [ExampleProject6]::Projects | Select-Object -Property Name, Guid

    Project Count: 0

    Name      Guid
    ----      ----
    Project_1 75e7c8a0-f8d1-433a-a5be-fd7249494694
    Project_2 6c501be4-e68c-4df5-8fce-e49dd8366afe

Example 7 - Defining a property in the constructor

The EXAMPLEPROJECT7 class defines the DURATION script property in the
static class constructor with the Update-TypeData cmdlet. Using the
Update-TypeData or Add-Member cmdlet is the only way to define advanced
properties for PowerShell classes.

The DURATION property returns a value of $null unless both the STARTDATE
and ENDDATE properties are set and STARTDATE is defined to be earlier than
the ENDDATE.

    class ExampleProject7 {
        [string]   $Name
        [int]      $Size
        [bool]     $Completed
        [string]   $Assignee
        [datetime] $StartDate
        [datetime] $EndDate
        [datetime] $DueDate

        static [hashtable[]] $MemberDefinitions = @(
            @{
                MemberName = 'Duration'
                MemberType = 'ScriptProperty'
                Value      = {
                    [datetime]$UnsetDate = 0

                    $StartNotSet   = $this.StartDate -eq $UnsetDate
                    $EndNotSet     = $this.EndDate   -eq $UnsetDate
                    $StartAfterEnd = $this.StartDate -gt $this.EndDate

                    if ($StartNotSet -or $EndNotSet -or $StartAfterEnd) {
                        return $null
                    }

                    return $this.EndDate - $this.StartDate
                }
            }
        )

        static ExampleProject7() {
            $TypeName = [ExampleProject7].Name
            foreach ($Definition in [ExampleProject7]::MemberDefinitions) {
                Update-TypeData -TypeName $TypeName @Definition
            }
        }

        ExampleProject7() {}

        ExampleProject7([string]$Name) {
            $this.Name = $Name
        }
    }

    $Project = [ExampleProject7]::new()
    $Project

    $null -eq $Project.Duration

    Duration  :
    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

    True

The default view for an instance of the EXAMPLEPROJECT7 class includes the
duration. Because the STARTDATE and ENDDATE properties aren't set, the
DURATION property is $null.

    $Project.StartDate = '2023-01-01'
    $Project.EndDate   = '2023-01-08'

    $Project

    Duration  : 7.00:00:00
    Name      :
    Size      : 0
    Completed : False
    Assignee  :
    StartDate : 1/1/2023 12:00:00 AM
    EndDate   : 1/8/2023 12:00:00 AM
    DueDate   : 1/1/0001 12:00:00 AM

With the properties set correctly, the DURATION property returns a timespan
representing how long the project ran.


Default property values

Every class property has an implicit default value depending on the type of
the property.

If a property is a reference type, like a string or an object, the implicit
default value is $null. If a property is a value type, like a number,
boolean, or enumeration, the property has a default value depending on the
type:

-   Numeric types, like integers and floating-point numbers, default to 0
-   Boolean values default to $false
-   Enumerations default to 0, even the enumeration doesn't define a label
    for 0.

For more information about default values in .NET, see Default values of C#
types (C# reference).

To define an explicit default value for a property, declare the property
with an assignment to the default value.

For example, this definition for the PROJECTTASK class defines an explicit
default value for the GUID property, assigning a random GUID to each new
instance.

    class ProjectTask {
        [string] $Name
        [string] $Description
        [string] $Guid = (New-Guid).Guid
    }

    [ProjectTask]::new()

    Name Description Guid
    ---- ----------- ----
                     aa96350c-358d-465c-96d1-a49949219eec

Hidden and static properties can also have default values.


Hidden properties

You can hide properties of a class by declaring them with the hidden
keyword. Hidden class properties are:

-   Not included in the default output for the class.
-   Not included in the list of class members returned by the Get-Member
    cmdlet. To show hidden properties with Get-Member, use the FORCE
    parameter.
-   Not displayed in tab completion or IntelliSense unless the completion
    occurs in the class that defines the hidden property.
-   Public members of the class. They can be accessed and modified. Hiding
    a property doesn't make it private. It only hides the property as
    described in the previous points.

For more information about the hidden keyword, see about_Hidden.


Static properties

You can define a property as belonging to the class itself instead of
instances of the class by declaring the property with the static keyword.
Static class properties:

-   Are always available, independent of class instantiation.
-   Are shared across all instances of the class.
-   Are always available.
-   Are modifiable. Static properties can be updated. They aren't immutable
    by default.
-   Live for the entire session span.

  [!IMPORTANT] Static properties for classes defined in PowerShell aren't
  immutable. They can be overridden to any valid value, as defined by the
  static property's type and attributes.


Derived class properties

When a class derives from a base class, it inherits the properties of the
base class. Any properties defined on the base class, including hidden
properties, are available on the derived class.

A derived class can override an inherited property by redefining it in the
class definition. The property on the derived class uses the redefined type
and default value, if any. If the inherited property defined a default
value and the redefined property doesn't, the inherited property has no
default value.

If a derived class doesn't override a static property, accessing the static
property through the derived class accesses the static property of the base
class. Modifying the property value through the derived class modifies the
value on the base class. Any other derived class that doesn't override the
static property also uses the value of the property on the base class.
Updating the value of an inherited static property in a class that doesn't
override the property might have unintended effects for classes derived
from the same base class.

The following example shows the behavior for static and instance properties
on derived classes.

    class BaseClass {
        static [string] $StaticProperty = 'Static'
        [string] $InstanceProperty = 'Instance'
    }
    class DerivedClassA : BaseClass     {}
    class DerivedClassB : BaseClass     {}
    class DerivedClassC : DerivedClassB {
        [string] $InstanceProperty
    }
    class DerivedClassD : BaseClass {
        static [string] $StaticProperty = 'Override'
        [string] $InstanceProperty = 'Override'
    }

    "Base instance      => $([BaseClass]::new().InstanceProperty)"
    "Derived instance A => $([DerivedClassA]::new().InstanceProperty)"
    "Derived instance B => $([DerivedClassB]::new().InstanceProperty)"
    "Derived instance C => $([DerivedClassC]::new().InstanceProperty)"
    "Derived instance D => $([DerivedClassD]::new().InstanceProperty)"

    Base instance      => Instance
    Derived instance A => Instance
    Derived instance B => Instance
    Derived instance C =>
    Derived instance D => Override

The INSTANCEPROPERTY for DERIVEDCLASSC is an empty string because the class
redefined the property without setting a default value. For DERIVEDCLASSD
the value is Override because the class redefined the property with that
string as the default value.

    "Base static        => $([BaseClass]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static A   => $([DerivedClassA]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static B   => $([DerivedClassB]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static C   => $([DerivedClassC]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static D   => $([DerivedClassD]::StaticProperty)"

    Base static        => Static
    Derived static A   => Static
    Derived static B   => Static
    Derived static C   => Static
    Derived static D   => Override

Except for DERIVEDCLASSD, the value of the static property for the derived
classes is the same as the base class, because they don't redefine the
property. This applies even to DERIVEDCLASSC, which inherits from
DERIVEDCLASSB instead of directly from BASECLASS.

    [DerivedClassA]::StaticProperty = 'Updated from A'
    "Base static        => $([BaseClass]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static A   => $([DerivedClassA]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static B   => $([DerivedClassB]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static C   => $([DerivedClassC]::StaticProperty)"
    "Derived static D   => $([DerivedClassD]::StaticProperty)"

    Base static        => Updated from A
    Derived static A   => Updated from A
    Derived static B   => Updated from A
    Derived static C   => Updated from A
    Derived static D   => Override

When STATICPROPERTY is accessed and modified through DERIVEDCLASSA, the
changed value affects every class except for DERIVEDCLASSD.

For more information about class inheritance, including a comprehensive
example, see about_Classes_Inheritance.


Using property attributes

PowerShell includes several attribute classes that you can use to enhance
data type information and validate the data assigned to a property.
Validation attributes allow you to test that values given to properties
meet defined requirements. Validation is triggered the moment that the
value is assigned.

For more information on available attributes, see
about_Functions_Advanced_Parameters.


Defining instance properties with Update-TypeData

Beyond declaring properties directly in the class definition, you can
define properties for instances of a class in the static constructor using
the Update-TypeData cmdlet.

Use this snippet as a starting point for the pattern. Replace the
placeholder text in angle brackets as needed.

    class <ClassName> {
        static [hashtable[]] $MemberDefinitions = @(
            @{
                MemberName = '<PropertyName>'
                MemberType = '<PropertyType>'
                Value      = <ValueDefinition>
            }
        )

        static <ClassName>() {
            $TypeName = [<ClassName>].Name
            foreach ($Definition in [<ClassName>]::MemberDefinitions) {
                Update-TypeData -TypeName $TypeName @Definition
            }
        }
    }

  [!TIP] The Add-Member cmdlet can add properties and methods to a class in
  non-static constructors, but the cmdlet is run every time the constructor
  is called. Using Update-TypeData in the static constructor ensures that
  the code for adding the members to the class only needs to run once in a
  session.

  Only add properties to the class in non-static constructors when they
  can't be defined with Update-TypeData, like read-only properties.

Defining alias properties

The ALIAS attribute has no effect when used on a class property
declaration. PowerShell only uses that attribute to define aliases for
cmdlet, parameter, and function names.

To define an alias for a class property, use Update-TypeData with the
AliasProperty MEMBERTYPE.

For example, this definition of the OPERABLEPAIR class defines two integer
properties X and Y with the aliases LEFTHANDSIDE and RIGHTHANDSIDE
respectively.

    class OperablePair {
        [int] $x
        [int] $y

        static [hashtable[]] $MemberDefinitions = @(
                @{
                    MemberType = 'AliasProperty'
                    MemberName = 'LeftHandSide'
                    Value      = 'x'
                }
                @{
                    MemberType = 'AliasProperty'
                    MemberName = 'RightHandSide'
                    Value      = 'y'
                }
        )

        static OperablePair() {
            $TypeName = [OperablePair].Name
            foreach ($Definition in [OperablePair]::MemberDefinitions) {
                Update-TypeData -TypeName $TypeName @Definition
            }
        }

        OperablePair() {}

        OperablePair([int]$x, [int]$y) {
            $this.x = $x
            $this.y = $y
        }

        # Math methods for the pair of values
        [int]   GetSum()        { return $this.x + $this.y }
        [int]   GetProduct()    { return $this.x * $this.y }
        [int]   GetDifference() { return $this.x - $this.y }
        [float] GetQuotient()   { return $this.x / $this.y }
        [int]   GetModulus()    { return $this.x % $this.y }
    }

With the aliases defined, users can access the properties with either name.

    $pair = [OperablePair]@{ x = 8 ; RightHandSide = 3 }

    "$($pair.x) % $($pair.y) = $($pair.GetModulus())"

    $pair.LeftHandSide  = 3
    $pair.RightHandSide = 2
    "$($pair.x) x $($pair.y) = $($pair.GetProduct())"

    8 % 3 = 2

    3 x 2 = 6

Defining calculated properties

To define a property that references the values of other properties, use
the Update-TypeData cmdlet with the ScriptProperty MEMBERTYPE.

For example, this definition of the BUDGET class defines the EXPENSES and
REVENUES properties as arrays of floating-point numbers. It uses the
Update-TypeData cmdlet to define calculated properties for total expenses,
total revenues, and net income.

    class Budget {
        [float[]] $Expenses
        [float[]] $Revenues

        static [hashtable[]] $MemberDefinitions = @(
            @{
                MemberType = 'ScriptProperty'
                MemberName = 'TotalExpenses'
                Value      = { ($this.Expenses | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum }
            }
            @{
                MemberType = 'ScriptProperty'
                MemberName = 'TotalRevenues'
                Value      = { ($this.Revenues | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum }
            }
            @{
                MemberType = 'ScriptProperty'
                MemberName = 'NetIncome'
                Value      = { $this.TotalRevenues - $this.TotalExpenses }
            }
        )

        static Budget() {
            $TypeName = [Budget].Name
            foreach ($Definition in [Budget]::MemberDefinitions) {
                Update-TypeData -TypeName $TypeName @Definition
            }
        }

        Budget() {}

        Budget($Expenses, $Revenues) {
            $this.Expenses = $Expenses
            $this.Revenues = $Revenues
        }
    }

    [Budget]::new()

    [Budget]@{
        Expenses = @(2500, 1931, 3700)
        Revenues = @(2400, 2100, 4150)
    }

    TotalExpenses : 0
    TotalRevenues : 0
    NetIncome     : 0
    Expenses      :
    Revenues      :

    TotalExpenses : 8131
    TotalRevenues : 8650
    NetIncome     : 519
    Expenses      : {2500, 1931, 3700}
    Revenues      : {2400, 2100, 4150}

Defining properties with custom get and set logic

PowerShell class properties can't define custom getter and setter logic
directly. You can approximate this functionality by defining a backing
property with the hidden keyword and using Update-TypeData to define a
visible property with custom logic for getting and setting the value.

By convention, define the hidden backing property name with an underscore
prefix and use camel casing. For example, instead of TaskCount, name the
hidden backing property _taskCount.

In this example, the PROJECTSIZE class defines a hidden integer property
named _VALUE. It defines VALUE as a ScriptProperty with custom logic for
getting and setting the _VALUE property. The setter scriptblock handles
converting the string representation of the project to the correct size.

    class ProjectSize {
        hidden [ValidateSet(0, 1, 2, 3)] [int] $_value

        static [hashtable[]] $MemberDefinitions = @(
            @{
                MemberType  = 'ScriptProperty'
                MemberName  = 'Value'
                Value       = { $this._value } # Getter
                SecondValue = {                # Setter
                    $ProposedValue = $args[0]

                    if ($ProposedValue -is [string]) {
                        switch ($ProposedValue) {
                            'Small'  { $this._value = 1 ; break }
                            'Medium' { $this._value = 2 ; break }
                            'Large'  { $this._value = 3 ; break }
                            default  { throw "Unknown size '$ProposedValue'" }
                        }
                    } else {
                        $this._value = $ProposedValue
                    }
                }
            }
        )

        static ProjectSize() {
            $TypeName = [ProjectSize].Name
            foreach ($Definition in [ProjectSize]::MemberDefinitions) {
                Update-TypeData -TypeName $TypeName @Definition
            }
        }

        ProjectSize()              {}
        ProjectSize([int]$Size)    { $this.Value = $Size }
        ProjectSize([string]$Size) { $this.Value = $Size }

        [string] ToString() {
            $Output = switch ($this._value) {
                1       { 'Small'     }
                2       { 'Medium'    }
                3       { 'Large'     }
                default { 'Undefined' }
            }

            return $Output
        }
    }

With the custom getter and setter defined, you can set the VALUE property
as either an integer or string.

    $size = [ProjectSize]::new()
    "The initial size is: $($size._value), $size"

    $size.Value = 1
    "The defined size is: $($size._value), $size"

    $Size.Value += 1
    "The updated size is: $($size._value), $size"

    $Size.Value = 'Large'
    "The final size is:   $($size._value), $size"

    The initial size is: 0, Undefined

    The defined size is: 1, Small

    The updated size is: 2, Medium

    The final size is:   3, Large


Limitations

PowerShell class properties have the following limitations:

-   Static properties are always mutable. PowerShell classes can't define
    immutable static properties.

    Workaround: None.

-   Properties can't use the VALIDATESCRIPT attribute, because class
    property attribute arguments must be constants.

    Workaround: Define a class that inherits from the
    VALIDATEARGUMENTSATTRIBUTE type and use that attribute instead.

-   Directly declared properties can't define custom getter and setter
    implementations.

    Workaround: Define a hidden property and use Update-TypeData to define
    the visible getter and setter logic.

-   Properties can't use the ALIAS attribute. The attribute only applies to
    parameters, cmdlets, and functions.

    Workaround: Use the Update-TypeData cmdlet to define aliases in the
    class constructors.

-   When a PowerShell class is converted to JSON with the ConvertTo-Json
    cmdlet, the output JSON includes all hidden properties and their
    values.

    Workaround: None
