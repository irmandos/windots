ABOUT_TYPE_CONVERSION


Short description

PowerShell has a flexible type system that makes it easier to use. However,
you must understand how it works to avoid unexpected results.


Long description

By default, PowerShell _variables_ aren't _type-constrained_. You can
create a variable containing an instance of one type and later assign
values of any other type. Also, PowerShell automatically converts values to
other types, both explicitly and implicitly. While implicit type conversion
can be helpful, there are pitfalls, especially for users more familiar with
languages that have stricter type handling.


Type-constrained variables and explicit types conversion

To type-constrain a variable, place a type literal to the left of the
variable name in an assignment. For example:

    [int]$foo = 42

You can use type casting to explicitly convert a value to a specific type.
For example:

    PS> $var = [int]'43'
    PS> $var.GetType().Name
    Int32

Type constraining ensures that only values of the specified type can be
assigned to the variable. PowerShell performs an implicit conversion if you
try to assign a value of a different type that can be converted to the
constrained type. For more information, see the Implicit type conversion
section of this article.

Numeric type conversion

Numeric types can be converted to any other numeric type as long as the
target type is capable of holding the converted value. For example:

    PS> (42.1).GetType().Name
    Double
    PS> $byte = [byte] 42.1
    PS> $byte
    42
    PS> $byte.GetType().Name
    Byte

The value 42.1 is a DOUBLE. When you cast it to a BYTE, PowerShell
truncates it to an integer 42, which is small enough to fit into a BYTE.

When converting real numbers to integer types, PowerShell uses rounding
rather than truncation, specifically using the _rounding-to-nearest-even_
method. The following examples illustrate this behavior. Both values are
rounded to the nearest even integer, 22.

    PS> [byte]21.5
    22
    PS> [byte]22.5
    22

For more information, see the _Midpoint values and rounding conventions_
section of the Math.Round method.

Boolean type conversion

A value of _any_ type can be coerced to a BOOLEAN.

-   For numeric types, 0 converts to $false and any other value converts to
    $true.

        PS> [boolean]0
        False
        PS> [boolean]0.0
        False
        PS> [boolean]-1
        True
        PS> [boolean]1
        True
        PS> [boolean]42.1
        True

-   For other types, null values, empty strings, and empty arrays are
    converted to $false.

        PS> [boolean]''
        False
        PS> [boolean]@()
        False
        PS> [boolean]'Hello'
        True

    Other values, including empty hashtables convert to $true.
    Single-element collections evaluate to the Boolean value of their one
    and only element. Collections with more than 1 element are always
    $true.

        PS> [boolean]@(0)
        False
        PS> [boolean]@(0,0)
        True
        PS> [boolean]@{}
        True

String type conversion

A value of _any_ type can be coerced to a STRING. The default conversion is
to call the ToString() method on the object.

Arrays are converted to strings. Each element in the array is converted to
a string, individually and joined to the resulting string. By default, the
converted values are separated by a space. The separator can be changed by
setting the $OFS preference variable.

    PS> [string] @(1, 2, 3)
    1 2 3

For more information about $OFS, see about_Preference_Variables.

A single string value can be converted to an instance of a type if the type
implements a static Parse() method. For example, [bigint]'42' is the same
as [bigint]::Parse('42', [cultureinfo]::InvariantCulture). The optional
[cultureinfo]::InvariantCulture value binds to an IFormatProvider type
parameter of the method. It ensures culture-invariant behavior of the
conversion. Not all implementations of Parse() methods have this parameter.

  [!NOTE] Conversion to and from strings is usually performed using the
  invariant culture. Invariant culture is based on, but not identical to,
  the US-English culture. Notably, it uses the period (.) as the decimal
  mark and US-style month-first dates by default. However, _binary cmdlets_
  perform culture-sensitive conversion during parameter binding.

Enum type conversion

PowerShell can convert Enum types to and from STRING instances. For
example, the typecast string [System.PlatformId]'Unix' is the same as the
enum value [System.PlatformId]::Unix. PowerShell also handles flag-based
enums correctly for comma-separated values inside a string or as an array
of strings. Consider the following examples:

    [System.Reflection.TypeAttributes]'Public, Abstract'
    [System.Reflection.TypeAttributes]('Public', 'Abstract')

These examples are equivalent to the enum expression:

    [System.Reflection.TypeAttributes]::Public -bor
        [System.Reflection.TypeAttributes]::Abstract

Other type conversions

A single value (non-array) can be converted to an instance of a type if:

-   That type has a (public) single-parameter constructor
-   And the value is the same type or can be coerced to the type of the
    parameter

For example, the following two lines are equivalent:

    [regex]'a|b'
    [regex]::new('a|b')`


Implicit types

PowerShell also assigns types to literal values automatically.

Numeric literals are implicitly typed by default. Numbers are typed based
on their size. For example, 42 is small enough to be stored as an INT32
type and 1.2 is stored as a DOUBLE. Integers larger than [Int32]::MaxValue
are stored as INT64. While 42 can be stored as a BYTE and 1.2 can be stored
as a SINGLE type, the implicit typing uses INT32 and DOUBLE respectively.
For more information, see about_Numeric_Literals.

Literal strings are implicitly typed as STRING. Single-character STRING
instances can be converted to and from the CHAR type. However, PowerShell
has no literal CHAR type.


Implicit type conversion

In certain contexts, PowerShell can implicitly convert values to other
types. These contexts include:

-   Parameter binding
-   Type-constrained variables
-   Expressions using operators
-   Boolean contexts - PowerShell converts the conditional expressions of
    if, while, do, or switch statements to BOOLEAN values, as previously
    described. For more information, see about_Booleans.
-   Extended Type System (ETS) type definitions - Type conversions can be
    defined in several ways:
    -   Using the TYPECONVERTER parameter of Update-TypeData
    -   In Types.ps1xml files
    -   In compiled code for types decorated with a TypeConverterAttribute
        attribute
    -   Via classes derived from TypeConverter or PSTypeConverter

Parameter binding conversions

PowerShell attempts to convert values passed to parameters to match the
parameter type. Type conversion of parameter values occurs in cmdlets,
functions, scripts, scriptblocks, or .NET methods where the parameter is
declared with a specific type. Declaring a parameter with the type [object]
or not defining a specific type allows any value type to be passed to a
parameter. Parameters can also have custom conversions defined by
decorating parameters with ArgumentTransformationAttribute attribute.

For more information, see about_Parameter_Binding.

Best practices for parameter binding

For .NET methods, it's better to pass the exact type expected using a type
casts where needed. Without exact types, PowerShell can select the wrong
method overload. Also, new method overloads added in future versions of
.NET can break existing code. For an extreme example of this problem, see
this Stack Overflow question.

If you pass an array to a [string] typed parameter, PowerShell might
convert the array to a string as previously described. Consider the
following basic function:

    function Test-String {
        param([string] $String)
        $String
    }

    Test-String -String 1, 2

This function outputs 1 2 because the array is converted to a string. To
avoid this behavior, create an advanced function by adding the
[CmdletBinding()] attribute.

    function Test-String {
        [CmdletBinding()]
        param([string] $String)
        $String
    }

    Test-String -String 1, 2

For advanced functions, PowerShell refuses to bind the array to a non-array
type. When you pass an array, PowerShell returns the following error
message:

    Test-String:
    Line |
       7 |  Test-String -String 1, 2
         |                      ~~~~
         | Cannot process argument transformation on parameter 'String'. Cannot
         | convert value to type System.String.

Unfortunately, you can't avoid this behavior for .NET method calls.

    PS> (Get-Date).ToString(@(1, 2))
    1 2

PowerShell converts the array to the string "1 2", which is passed to the
FORMAT parameter of the ToString() method.

The following example shows another instance of the array conversion
problem.

    PS> $bytes = [byte[]] @(1..16)
    PS> $guid = New-Object System.Guid($bytes)
    New-Object: Cannot find an overload for "Guid" and the argument count: "16".

PowerShell treats the $bytes array as a list of individual parameters even
though $bytes is an array of bytes and System.Guid has a Guid(Byte[])
constructor.

This common code pattern is an instance of _pseudo method syntax_, which
doesn't always work as intended. This syntax translates to:

    PS> [byte[]] $bytes = 1..16
    PS> New-Object -TypeName System.Guid -ArgumentList $bytes
    New-Object: Cannot find an overload for "Guid" and the argument count: "16".

Given that the type of ARGUMENTLIST is [object[]], a single argument that
happens to be an array (of any type) binds to it _element by element_. The
workaround is to wrap $bytes in an outer array so that PowerShell looks for
a constructor with parameters that match the contents of the outer array.

    PS> [byte[]] $bytes = 1..16
    PS> $guid = New-Object -TypeName System.Guid -ArgumentList (, $bytes)
    PS> $guid

    Guid
    ----
    04030201-0605-0807-090a-0b0c0d0e0f10

The first item of the wrapped array is our original Byte[] instance. That
value matches the Guid(Byte[]] constructor.

An alternative to the array wrapping workaround is to use the intrinsic
static new() method.

    PS> [byte[]] $bytes = 1..16
    PS> [System.Guid]::new($bytes)  # OK

    Guid
    ----
    04030201-0605-0807-090a-0b0c0d0e0f10

Type-constrained variable conversions

When you assign a value to a type-constrained variable, PowerShell attempts
to convert the value to the variable type. If the value provided can be
converted to the variable type, the assignment succeeds.

For example:

    PS> [int]$foo = '43'
    PS> $foo.GetType().Name
    Int32

The conversion works because the string '43' can be converted to a number.


Operator conversions

PowerShell can implicitly convert the operands in an expression to produce
a reasonable result. Also, some operators have type-specific behaviors.

Numeric operations

In numeric operations, even if both operands are the same numeric type, the
result can be a different type, due to automatic type conversion to
accommodate the result.

    PS> [int]$a = 1
    PS> [int]$b = 2
    PS> $result = $a / $b
    PS> $result
    0.5
    PS> $result.GetType().Name
    Double

Even though both operands are integers, the result is converted to a DOUBLE
to support the fractional result. To get true integer division, use the
[int]::Truncate() or [Math]::DivRem() static methods. For more information,
see Truncate() and DivRem().

In integer arithmetic, when the result overflows the size of the operands,
PowerShell defaults to using DOUBLE for the results, even when the result
could fit into an INT64 type.

    PS> $result = [int]::MaxValue + 1
    PS> $result
    2147483648
    PS> $result.GetType().Name
    Double

If you want the result to be an INT64, you can cast the result type or
operands.

    PS> ([Int64]([int]::MaxValue + 1)).GetType().Name
    Int64

However, use care when casting results to a specific type. For example,
type casting the result to the [decimal] type can lead to loss of
precision. Adding 1 to the maximum INT64 value results in a DOUBLE type.
When you cast a DOUBLE to a DECIMAL type, the result is
9223372036854780000, which isn't accurate.

    PS> ([int64]::MaxValue + 1).GetType().Name
    Double
    PS> [decimal]([int64]::MaxValue + 1)
    9223372036854780000

The conversion is limited to 15 digits of precision. For more information,
see the _Remarks_ section of the Decimal(Double) constructor documentation.

To avoid a loss of precision, use the D suffix on the 1 literal. By adding
the D suffix, PowerShell converts the [int64]::MaxValue to a DECIMAL before
adding 1D.

    PS> ([int64]::MaxValue + 1D).GetType().Name
    Decimal
    PS> ([int64]::MaxValue + 1D)
    9223372036854775808

For more information about numeric suffixes, see about_Numeric_Literals.

Usually, the left-hand side (LHS) operand of PowerShell operators
determines the data type used in the operation. PowerShell converts
(coerces) the right-hand side (RHS) operand to the required type.

    PS> 10 - ' 9 '
    1

In this example, the RHS operand is the string ' 9 ', which is implicitly
converted to an integer before the subtraction operation. The same is true
for the comparison operators.

    PS> 10 -eq ' 10'
    True
    PS> 10 -eq '0xa'
    True

There are exceptions when using arithmetic_ operators (+, -, *, /) with
_non-numeric_ operands.

When you use the - and / operands with strings, PowerShell converts both
operands from strings to numbers.

    PS> '10' - '2'
    8
    PS> '10' / '2'
    5

By contrast, the + and * operators have string-specific semantics
(concatenation and replication).

    PS> '10' + '2'
    102
    PS> '10' * '2'
    1010

When you use BOOLEAN values with arithmetic operators, PowerShell converts
the values to integers: $true becomes [int]1 and $false becomes [int]0.

    PS> $false - $true
    -1

The one exception is the multiplication (*) of two booleans.

    PS> $false * $true
    InvalidOperation: The operation '[System.Boolean] * [System.Boolean]' is not
    defined.

For other LHS types, arithmetic operators only succeed if a given type
custom-defines these operators via operator overloading.

Comparison operations

The comparison operators, such as -eq, -lt, and -gt, can compare operands
of different types. The behavior of non-strings and non-primitive types
depends on whether the LHS type implements interfaces such as IEquatable
and IComparable.

The collection-based comparison operators (-in and -contains) perform per
element -eq comparisons until a match is found. It's each individual
element of the collection operand that drives any type coercion.

    PS> $true -in 'true', 'false'
    True
    PS> 'true', 'false' -contains $true
    True

Both examples return true because 'true' -eq $true yields $true.

For more information, see about_Comparison_Operators.
