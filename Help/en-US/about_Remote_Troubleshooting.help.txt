ABOUT_REMOTE_TROUBLESHOOTING


Short description

Describes how to troubleshoot remote operations in PowerShell.


Long description

Before using PowerShell remoting, see about_Remote and
about_Remote_Requirements for guidance on configuration and basic use.

You must have administrative rights to view or change settings for the
local computer in the WSMan: drive. This includes changes to session
configuration, trusted hosts, ports, or listeners.

You must run PowerShell with the RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR option.


How to run as administrator

For error:

  ERROR: Access is denied. You need to run this cmdlet from an elevated
  process.

To start Windows PowerShell with the RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR option,
right-click on the PowerShell icon in the Start Menu and select RUN AS
ADMINISTRATOR.


How to enable remoting

For errors:

  -   ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED
  -   ERROR: The connection to the remote host was refused. Verify that the
      WS-Management service is running on the remote host and configured to
      listen for requests on the correct port and HTTP URL.

To receive remote commands, PowerShell remoting must be enabled on the
computer. Windows PowerShell remoting is enabled by default on Windows
Server 2012 and newer releases of Windows Server. You can run
Enable-PSRemoting to re-enable remoting if it was disabled. For more
information, see Enable-PSRemoting.


How to enable remoting in an enterprise

For errors:

  -   ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED
  -   ERROR: The connection to the remote host was refused. Verify that the
      WS-Management service is running on the remote host and configured to
      listen for requests on the correct port and HTTP URL.

To enable a single computer to receive remote PowerShell commands and
accept connections, use the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet.

To enable remoting for multiple computers in an enterprise, you can use the
following scaled options.

-   Enable the ALLOW AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION OF LISTENERS group policy to
    configure listeners for remoting.
-   Configure and enable the WINDOWS FIREWALL: ALLOW LOCAL PORT EXCEPTIONS
    group policy.
-   Set the startup type of the WinRM service to Automatic and start the
    service.

How to enable listeners by using a group policy

For errors:

  -   ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED
  -   ERROR: The connection to the remote host was refused. Verify that the
      WS-Management service is running on the remote host and configured to
      listen for requests on the correct port and HTTP URL.

Enable the ALLOW AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION OF LISTENERS policy to configure
the listeners for all computers in a domain.

The policy is found in the following Group Policy path:

    Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components
        \Windows Remote Management (WinRM)\WinRM service

Enable the policy and specify the IPv4 and IPv6 filters. Wildcards (*) are
permitted.

How to enable remoting on public networks

Enable-PSRemoting returns this error when the local network is public and
the SKIPNETWORKPROFILECHECK parameter is not used in the command.

  ERROR: Unable to check the status of the firewall

On server versions of Windows, Enable-PSRemoting succeeds on all network
profiles. It creates firewall rules that allow remote access to private and
domain ("Home" and "Work") networks. For public networks, it creates
firewall rules that allows remote access from the same local subnet.

On client versions of Windows, Enable-PSRemoting succeeds on private and
domain networks. By default, it fails on public networks, but if you use
the SKIPNETWORKPROFILECHECK parameter, Enable-PSRemoting succeeds and
creates a firewall rule that allows traffic from the same local subnet.

  [!NOTE] In Windows PowerShell 2.0, on computers running server versions
  of Windows, Enable-PSRemoting creates firewall rules that allow remote
  access on private, domain and public networks. On computers running
  client versions of Windows, Enable-PSRemoting creates firewall rules that
  allow remote access only on private and domain networks.

To remove the local subnet restriction on public networks and allow remote
access from any location, run the following command:

    Set-NetFirewallRule -Name "WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC" -RemoteAddress Any

The Set-NetFirewallRule cmdlet is exported by the NETSECURITY module.

  [!NOTE] The name of the firewall rule can be different for different
  versions of Windows. Use Get-NetFirewallRule to see a list of rules.
  Before enabling the firewall rule, view the security settings in the rule
  to verify that the configuration is appropriate for your environment.

How to enable a firewall exception by using a group policy

For errors:

  -   ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED
  -   ERROR: The connection to the remote host was refused. Verify that the
      WS-Management service is running on the remote host and configured to
      listen for requests on the correct port and HTTP URL.

Use the WINDOWS FIREWALL: ALLOW LOCAL PORT EXCEPTIONS policy to enable a
firewall exception for in all computers in a domain.

The policy is located in the following Group Policy path:

    Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Network
        \Network Connections\Windows Firewall\Domain Profile

This policy allows members of the Administrators group to create a firewall
exception for the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service.

If the policy configuration is incorrect you may receive the following
error:

  The client cannot connect to the destination specified in the request.
  Verify that the service on the destination is running and is accepting
  requests.

A configuration error in the policy results in an empty value for the
LISTENINGON property. Use the following command to check the value.

    Get-WSManInstance winrm/config/listener -Enumerate

    cfg                   : http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/config/listener
    xsi                   : http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
    Source                : GPO
    lang                  : en-US
    Address               : *
    Transport             : HTTP
    Port                  : 5985
    Hostname              :
    Enabled               : true
    URLPrefix             : wsman
    CertificateThumbprint :
    ListeningOn           : {}

How to set the startup type of the WinRM service

For error:

  ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED

PowerShell remoting depends upon the Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
service. The service must be running to support remote commands.

On server versions of Windows, the WinRM service startup type is Automatic.
However, on client versions of Windows, the WinRM service is disabled by
default.

Use the following example to set the startup type of the WinRM service to
Automatic and start the service. The COMPUTERNAME parameter accepts
multiple values.

    $invokeCimMethodSplat = @{
        ComputerName = 'Server01', 'Server02'
        Query = 'Select * From Win32_Service Where Name = "WinRM"'
        MethodName = 'ChangeStartMode'
        Arguments = @{StartMode  = 'Automatic'}
    }
    Invoke-CimMethod @invokeCimMethodSplat


How to recreate the default session configurations

For error:

  ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED

When you use Enable-PSRemoting, it creates default session configurations
on the local computer. Remote users use these session configurations
whenever a remote command does not include the CONFIGURATIONNAME parameter.

If the default configurations on a computer are unregistered or deleted,
use the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet to recreate them. You can use this cmdlet
repeatedly. It doesn't generate errors if a feature is already configured.

If you change the default session configurations and want to restore the
original session configurations you can delete and recreate the
configurations.

Use the Unregister-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet to delete the changed
session configurations. Use Enable-PSRemoting to restore the original
session configurations. Enable-PSRemoting doesn't change existing session
configurations.

  [!NOTE] When Enable-PSRemoting restores the default session
  configuration, it does not create explicit security descriptors for the
  configurations. Instead, the configurations inherit the security
  descriptor of the ROOTSDDL, which is secure by default.

To see the ROOTSDDL security descriptor, type:

    Get-Item wsman:\localhost\Service\RootSDDL

To change the ROOTSDDL, use the Set-Item cmdlet in the WSMan: drive. To
change the security descriptor of a session configuration, use the
Set-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet with the SECURITYDESCRIPTORSDDL or
SHOWSECURITYDESCRIPTORUI parameters.

For more information about the WSMan: drive, see about_WSMan_Provider.


How to provide administrator credentials

For error:

  ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED

You must be a member of the Administrators group connect to the default
remote session endpoints. You can use the CREDENTIAL parameter of the
New-PSSession, Enter-PSSession or Invoke-Command cmdlets to connect to
remote endpoints using alternate credentials.

The following example shows how to provide the credentials for an admin
user.

    Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -Credential Domain01\Admin01

For more information about the CREDENTIAL parameter, see the help for
New-PSSession, Enter-PSSession or Invoke-Command.


How to enable remoting for non-administrative users

For error:

  ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED

By default, only members of the Administrators group on a computer have
permission to use the default session configurations. Therefore, only
members of the Administrators group can connect to the computer remotely.

To allow other users to connect to the local computer, give the user
EXECUTE permissions to the default session configurations on the local
computer.

The following example opens a property sheet that lets you change the
security descriptor of the default Microsoft.PowerShell session
configuration on the local computer.

    Set-PSSessionConfiguration Microsoft.PowerShell -ShowSecurityDescriptorUI

For more information, see about_Session_Configurations.


How to enable remoting for administrators in other domains

For error:

  ERROR: ACCESS IS DENIED

When a user in another domain is a member of the Administrators group on
the local computer, the user cannot connect to the local computer remotely
with Administrator privileges. By default, remote connections from other
domains run with only standard user privilege tokens.

You can use the LOCALACCOUNTTOKENFILTERPOLICY registry entry to change the
default behavior and allow remote users who are members of the
Administrators group to run with Administrator privileges.

  [!CAUTION] The LOCALACCOUNTTOKENFILTERPOLICY entry disables user account
  control (UAC) remote restrictions for all users of all affected
  computers. Consider the implications of this setting carefully before
  changing the policy.

Use the following command to set the LOCALACCOUNTTOKENFILTERPOLICY registry
value to 1.

    $newItemPropertySplat = @{
      Name = 'LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy'
      Path = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System'
      PropertyType = 'DWord'
      Value = 1
    }
    New-ItemProperty @newItemPropertySplat


How to use an ip address in a remote command

For error:

  ERROR: The WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication
  scheme is different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not
  joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport must be used or the destination
  machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting.

The COMPUTERNAME parameter of the New-PSSession, Enter-PSSession and
Invoke-Command cmdlets accepts an IP address as a valid value. However,
because Kerberos authentication doesn't support IP addresses. When you
specify an IP address, NTLM authentication is used.

To support NTLM authentication, you must meet the following requirements:

-   Configure the computer for HTTPS transport or add the IP addresses of
    the remote computers to the TRUSTEDHOSTS list on the local computer.
-   Use the CREDENTIAL parameter in all remote commands. This is required
    even when you connect as the current user.


How to connect remotely from a workgroup-based computer

For error

  ERROR: The WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication
  scheme is different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not
  joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport must be used or the destination
  machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting.

When the local computer isn't in a domain, you must meet the following
requirements:

-   Configure the computer for HTTPS transport or add the IP addresses of
    the remote computers to the TRUSTEDHOSTS list on the local computer.
-   Verify that a password is set on the workgroup-based computer. If a
    password is not set or the password value is empty, you cannot run
    remote commands.
-   Use the CREDENTIAL parameter in all remote commands. This is required
    even when you connect as the current user.


How to add a computer to the trusted hosts list

The TRUSTEDHOSTS item can contain a comma-separated list of computer names,
IP addresses, and fully-qualified domain names. Wildcards are permitted.

To view or change the trusted host list, use the WSMan: drive. The
TRUSTEDHOST item is in the WSMan:\localhost\Client node. Only members of
the Administrators group on the computer have permission to change the list
of trusted hosts on the computer.

  [!CAUTION] The value that you set for the TRUSTEDHOSTS item affects all
  users of the computer.

To view the list of trusted hosts, use the following command:

    Get-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts

The following example uses the wildcard character (*) to add all computers
to the list of trusted hosts.

    Set-Item wsman:localhost\client\trustedhosts -Value *

You can also use a wildcard character (*) to add all computers in a
particular domain to the list of trusted hosts. For example, the following
command adds all of the computers in the Fabrikam domain.

    Set-Item wsman:localhost\client\trustedhosts *.fabrikam.com

The following example set the list of trusted hosts to a single computer.

    $server = 'Server01.Domain01.Fabrikam.com'
    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value $server

To add a computer name to an existing list of trusted hosts, first save the
current value in a variable. Then set the value to a string containing a
comma-separated list that includes the current and new values.

The following example add Server01 to an existing list of trusted hosts.

    $newServer = 'Server01.Domain01.Fabrikam.com'
    $curValue = (Get-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts).Value
    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "$curValue, $newServer"

To add the IP addresses of particular computers to the list of trusted
hosts, use the following command format:

    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value <IP Address>

For example:

    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value 172.16.0.0

To add a computer to the TRUSTEDHOSTS list of a remote computer, use the
Connect-WSMan to connect to WSMan: drive the remote computer the use
Set-Item to add the computer.

For more information about, see the help for Connect-WSMan.


How to configure remoting on alternate ports

For error:

  ERROR: The connection to the specified remote host was refused. Verify
  that the WS-Management service is running on the remote host and
  configured to listen for requests on the correct port and HTTP URL.

PowerShell remoting uses port 80 for HTTP transport by default. The default
port is used whenever the user does not specify the CONNECTIONURI or PORT
parameters in a remote command.

Use Set-Item cmdlet to change the PORT value in the listener leaf node.

For example, the following command changes the default port to 8080.

    Set-Item wsman:\localhost\listener\listener*\port -Value 8080


How to configure remoting with a proxy server

For error:

  ERROR: The client cannot connect to the destination specified in the
  request. Verify that the service on the destination is running and is
  accepting requests.

Because PowerShell remoting uses the HTTP protocol, it is affected by HTTP
proxy settings. In enterprises that have proxy servers, users cannot access
a PowerShell remote computer directly.

To resolve this problem, use proxy setting options in your remote command.

-   Use the PROXYACCESSTYPE, PROXYAUTHENTICATION, and PROXYCREDENTIAL
    parameters of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet to create a variable
    containing a PSSESSIONOPTION object with the proxy settings for your
    enterprise.
-   Use the variable containing the PSSESSIONOPTION object wit the
    SESSIONOPTION parameter of a New-PSSession, Enter-PSSession, or
    Invoke-Command command.

    $newPSSessionOptionSplat = @{
        ProxyAccessType = 'IEConfig'
        ProxyAuthentication = 'Negotiate'
        ProxyCredential = 'Domain01\User01'
    }
    $SessionOption = New-PSSessionOption @newPSSessionOptionSplat

    $newPSSessionSplat = @{
        ConnectionUri = 'https://www.fabrikam.com'
        SessionOption = $SessionOption
    }
    New-PSSession @newPSSessionSplat

For more information about the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet, see
New-PSSessionOption.

To set these options for all remote commands in the current session, set
the $PSSessionOption preference variable to the PSSESSIONOPTION object you
created. For more information, see about_Preference_Variables.

To set these options for all remote commands in all PowerShell sessions on
the local computer, add the $PSSessionOption preference variable to your
PowerShell profile. For more information about PowerShell profiles, see
about_Profiles.


How to detect a 32-bit session on a 64-bit computer

For error:

  ERROR: The term <tool-name> is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
  function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the
  name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try
  again.

If the remote computer is running a 64-bit version of Windows, and the
remote command uses a 32-bit session configuration, like
MICROSOFT.POWERSHELL32, WinRM loads a WOW64 process. Windows automatically
redirects all references to $env:Windir\System32 to the
$env:Windir\SysWOW64 directory.

As a result, running tools in the System32 directory that do not have
counterparts in the SysWow64 directory can't be found.

To find the processor architecture that is being used in the session, use
the value of the PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE environment variable.

    $s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -ConfigurationName CustomShell
    Invoke-Command -Session $s {$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE}

    x86

For more information, see about_Session_Configurations.


Troubleshooting policy and preference issues

This section discusses remoting problems that are related to policies and
preferences set on the local and remote computers.


How to change the execution policy for Import-PSSession and Import-Module

For error:

  ERROR: Import-Module: File <filename> cannot be loaded because the
  execution of scripts is disabled on this system.

The Import-PSSession and Export-PSSession cmdlets create modules that
contains unsigned script files and formatting files.

To import the modules that are created by these cmdlets, the execution
policy in the current session can't be Restricted or AllSigned. For more
information, see about_Execution_Policies.

To import the modules without changing the execution policy for the local
computer, use the SCOPE parameter of Set-ExecutionPolicy to set a less
restrictive execution policy for a single process.

For example, the following example sets the execution policy to
RemoteSigned for the current process. The change only affects the current
process.

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

You can also use the EXECUTIONPOLICY parameter of PowerShell.exe to start a
single session with a less restrictive execution policy.

    pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned


How to set and change quotas

You can use quotas to protect the local computer and the remote computer
from excessive resource use, both accidental and malicious. When quotas
conflict with a command, PowerShell generates the following error.

  ERROR: The total data received from the remote client exceeded allowed
  maximum.

The WSMan provider has the following quota settings:

-   The MAXENVELOPESIZEKB and MAXPROVIDERREQUESTS settings in the
    WSMan:<ComputerName> node and the MAXCONCURRENTOPERATIONS,
    MAXCONCURRENTOPERATIONSPERUSER, and MAXCONNECTIONS settings in the
    WSMan:<ComputerName>\Service node.
-   You can use the MAXIMUMRECEIVEDDATASIZEPERCOMMAND and
    MAXIMUMRECEIVEDOBJECTSIZE parameters of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet
    and the $PSSessionOption preference variable to protect the local
    computer.
-   To protect the remote computer, add restrictions to the session
    configurations using the MAXIMUMRECEIVEDDATASIZEPERCOMMANDMB and
    MAXIMUMRECEIVEDOBJECTSIZEMB parameters of the
    Register-PSSessionConfiguration cmdlet.

To resolve the error, change the remote command to comply with the quota or
increase the quota to allow the command to complete.

For example, the following command increases the object size quota in the
MICROSOFT.POWERSHELL session configuration on the remote computer from 10
MB (the default value) to 11 MB.

    $setPSSessionConfigurationSplat = @{
        Name = 'Microsoft.PowerShell'
        MaximumReceivedObjectSizeMB = 11
        Force = $true
    }
    Set-PSSessionConfiguration @setPSSessionConfigurationSplat

For more information about the WS-Management quotas, see
about_WSMan_Provider.


How to resolve timeout errors

You can use timeouts to protect the local computer and the remote computer
from excessive resource use, both accidental and malicious. When timeouts
are set on both the local and remote computer, PowerShell uses the shortest
timeout settings.

When a timeout value does not permit an operation to complete, PowerShell
terminates the operation and generates the following error.

  ERROR: The WS-Management service cannot complete the operation within the
  time specified in OperationTimeout.

The WSMan provider has the following timeouts settings.

-   MAXTIMEOUTMS setting in the WSMan:<ComputerName> node and the
    ENUMERATIONTIMEOUTMS and MAXPACKETRETRIEVALTIMESECONDS settings in the
    WSMan:<ComputerName>\Service node.
-   You can protect the local computer using the CANCELTIMEOUT,
    IDLETIMEOUT, OPENTIMEOUT, and OPERATIONTIMEOUT parameters of the
    New-PSSessionOption cmdlet and the $PSSessionOption preference
    variable.
-   You can also protect the remote computer by setting timeout values
    programmatically in the session configuration for the session.

To resolve the error, change the command to complete within the timeout
interval or increase the timeout interval to allow the command to complete.

The following example creates a session option with an OPERATIONTIMEOUT
value of 4 minutes (in MS), then uses the session option to create a remote
session.

    $pso = New-PSSessionOption -OperationTimeout 240000
    New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -SessionOption $pso

For more information about the WS-Management timeouts, see
about_WSMan_Provider.


How to interrupt a command that is unresponsive

Some native programs, such as programs with a user interface, console
applications that prompt for input, and console applications that use the
Win32 console API, do not work correctly in the PowerShell remote host.

When you use these programs, you might see unexpected behavior, such as no
output, partial output, or a remote command that does not complete.

To end an unresponsive program, type Ctrl+c. Use Get-Error in the local
host and the remote session to view any errors that might have been
reported.


How to recover from an operation failure

The following error is returned when an operation is terminated before it
completes.

  ERROR: The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit
  or an application request.

Typically, this occurs when the WinRM service stops or restarts while other
WinRM operations are in progress.

To resolve this issue, verify that the WinRM service is running and try the
command again.

1.  Start PowerShell with the RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR option.

2.  Run the following command:

    Start-Service WinRM

3.  Re-run the command that generated the error.


Linux and macOS limitations

PowerShell remoting is Linux and macOS using remoting over SSH. For more
information, see PowerShell Remoting Over SSH.
