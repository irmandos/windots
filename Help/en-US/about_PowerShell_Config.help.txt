Short description

Configuration files for PowerShell, replacing Registry configuration.


Long description

The powershell.config.json file contains configuration settings for
PowerShell. PowerShell loads this configuration at startup. The settings
can also be modified at runtime. Previously, these settings were stored in
the Windows Registry for PowerShell, but are now contained in a file to
enable configuration on macOS and Linux.


Summary of settings

The powershell.config.json file can contain the following keys:

-   DisableImplicitWinCompat
-   WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList
-   WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList
-   ExperimentalFeatures
-   LogChannels
-   LogIdentity
-   LogKeywords
-   LogLevel
-   Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy
-   PSModulePath
-   PowerShellPolicies
    -   ExecutionPolicy
    -   ConsoleSessionConfiguration
    -   ModuleLogging
    -   ProtectedEventLogging
    -   ScriptBlockLogging
    -   ScriptExecution
    -   Transcription
    -   UpdatableHelp

Not all keys apply to all platforms. The PowerShellPolicies key contains
subkeys that mirror the settings managed by Window Group Policy. Those
subkeys also apply to all platforms when defined at the root level of the
JSON file.

  [!WARNING] Unrecognized keys or invalid values in the configuration file
  are ignored. If the powershell.config.json file contains invalid JSON,
  PowerShell can't start an interactive session. If this occurs, you must
  fix the configuration file.


Configuration scope

Configuration settings can be defined for all users or at the individual
user level.

AllUsers (shared) configuration

A powershell.config.json file in the $PSHOME directory defines the
configuration for all PowerShell sessions running from that PowerShell
installation.

  [!NOTE] The $PSHOME location is defined as the same directory as the
  executing System.Management.Automation.dll assembly. This applies to
  hosted PowerShell SDK instances as well.

CurrentUser (per-user) configurations

You can also configure PowerShell on a per-user basis by placing the file
in the user-scope configuration directory. The user configuration directory
can be found across platforms with the command
Split-Path $PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost.

Scope precedence

On Windows, settings managed by Windows Group Policy take precedence over
settings in the configuration file. Group Policy doesn't exist on
non-Windows platforms.

After Group Policy, settings defined at the ALLUSERS level take precedence
over settings defined for the CURRENTUSER level.


Windows-specific settings

The following settings only apply to Windows platforms.

-   DisableImplicitWinCompat
-   WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList
-   WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList
-   ExecutionPolicy
-   PowerShellPolicies

DisableImplicitWinCompat

When set to true, this setting disables the Windows PowerShell
Compatibility feature. Windows PowerShell Compatibility allows PowerShell 7
to load Windows PowerShell 5.1 modules in compatibility mode.

For more information, see about_Windows_PowerShell_Compatibility.

WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList

This setting is an array of module names that you want to exclude from
participation in the Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature.

For more information, see about_Windows_PowerShell_Compatibility.

WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList

This setting is an array of module names that shouldn't be clobbered by
loading the Windows PowerShell 5.1 version of the module.

For more information, see about_Windows_PowerShell_Compatibility.

ExecutionPolicy

  [!IMPORTANT] This configuration only applies on Windows platforms.

Configures the execution policy for PowerShell sessions, determining what
scripts can be run. By default, PowerShell uses the existing execution
policy.

For ALLUSERS configurations, this sets the LOCALMACHINE execution policy.
For CURRENTUSER configurations, this sets the CURRENTUSER execution policy.

The following example sets the execution policy of PowerShell to
RemoteSigned.

    {
      "Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy": "RemoteSigned"
    }

For more information, see about_Execution_Policies.

PowerShellPolicies

Windows has several settings that can be managed by Group Policy. Usually,
those setting are stored in the Windows registry. Those setting can also be
defined in the powershell.config.json file.

The PowerShellPolicies is a JSON object that contains key-value pairs for
the various policy settings. Those policy settings can also be listed at
the root level of the JSON file, outside of the PowerShellPolicies object.
This setting can contain the following subkeys:

-   ConsoleSessionConfiguration
-   ModuleLogging
-   ProtectedEventLogging
-   ScriptBlockLogging
-   ScriptExecution
-   Transcription
-   UpdatableHelp

The ScriptExecution setting is used to set the PowerShell Execution Policy.
This takes precedence over the ExecutionPolicy setting described above.

Example:

    {
        "PowerShellPolicies": {
            "ScriptExecution": {
                "ExecutionPolicy": "RemoteSigned"
            }
        }
    }

For descriptions of the other policy settings, see the descriptions in the
Common configuration settings section.

On Windows, PowerShell looks for the settings in the registry. Any settings
found in the registry have precedence. Next PowerShell reads the JSON
configuration. Any settings found under PowerShellPolicies, and not defined
in the registry, take precedence over settings found at the root level of
the JSON configuration.

For more information, see about_Group_Policy_Settings.


Settings for non-Windows platforms

The following settings only apply to Linux and macOS platforms.

The following keys are used to configure PowerShell's logging for Linux and
macOS.

-   LogChannels
-   LogIdentity
-   LogKeywords
-   LogLevel

For a full description of PowerShell logging for non-Windows systems, see
about_Logging_Non-Windows.


Common configuration settings

The following settings are available on all supported platforms.

-   ConsoleSessionConfiguration
-   ExperimentalFeatures
-   ModuleLogging
-   ProtectedEventLogging
-   PSModulePath
-   ScriptBlockLogging
-   ScriptExecution
-   Transcription
-   UpdatableHelp

ConsoleSessionConfiguration

This setting specifies the session configuration to be used for all
PowerShell sessions. This can be any endpoint registered on the local
machine including the default PowerShell remoting endpoints or a custom
endpoint having specific user role capabilities.

This key contains two subkeys:

-   EnableConsoleSessionConfiguration - to enable session configurations,
    set the value to true. By default, this value is false.

-   ConsoleSessionConfigurationName - Specifies the name of configuration
    endpoint in which PowerShell is run. By default, there is no session
    defined.

    {
      "ConsoleSessionConfiguration": {
        "EnableConsoleSessionConfiguration": false,
        "ConsoleSessionConfigurationName" : []
      }
    }

For more information, see about_Session_Configurations.

ExperimentalFeatures

The names of the experimental features to enable in PowerShell. The default
value is an empty array.

The following example enables the PSCOMMANDNOTFOUNDSUGGESTION and
PSSUBSYSTEMPLUGINMODEL experimental features when PowerShell starts up.

Example:

    {
      "ExperimentalFeatures": [
        "PSCommandNotFoundSuggestion",
        "PSSubsystemPluginModel"
      ]
    }

For more information on experimental features, see Using experimental
features.

ModuleLogging

This setting controls the behavior of logging for PowerShell modules. The
setting contains two subkeys:

-   EnableModuleLogging - to enable module logging, set the value to true.
    When enabled, pipeline execution events for members of the specified
    modules are recorded in the PowerShell log files.
-   ModuleNames - Specifies the name of the modules that should be logged.

Example:

    {
      "ModuleLogging": {
        "EnableModuleLogging": true,
        "ModuleNames" : [
            "PSReadLine",
            "PowerShellGet"
        ]
      }
    }

ProtectedEventLogging

This setting lets you configure Protected Event Logging. The setting
contains two subkeys:

-   EnableProtectedEventLogging - If you enable this policy setting,
    components that support it use the certificate you supply to encrypt
    log data before writing it to the log. Data is encrypted using the
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) standard. You can use
    Unprotect-CmsMessage to decrypt these encrypted messages, if you have
    access to the private key of the certificate.
-   EncryptionCertificate - Provides a list of name of certificates to be
    used for encryption.

Example:

    {
      "ProtectedEventLogging": {
        "EnableProtectedEventLogging": false,
        "EncryptionCertificate": [
          "Joe"
        ]
      }
    }

PSModulePath

Overrides the PSModulePath settings for this PowerShell session. If the
configuration is for the current user, sets the CURRENTUSER module path. If
the configuration is for all users, sets the ALLUSERS module path.

  [!WARNING] Configuring an ALLUSERS or CURRENTUSER module path here
  doesn't change the scoped installation location for PowerShellGet cmdlets
  like Install-Module. These cmdlets always use the _default_ module paths.

If no value is set, PowerShell uses the default value for the respective
module path setting. For more information about these defaults, see
about_PSModulePath.

This setting allows environment variables to be used by embedding them
between % characters, like "%HOME%\Documents\PowerShell\Modules", in the
same way that the Windows Command Shell allows. This syntax also applies on
Linux and macOS. See below for examples.

This example shows a PSModulePath configuration for a Windows environment:

    {
      "PSModulePath": "C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6\\Modules"
    }

This example shows a PSModulePath configuration for a macOS or Linux
environment:

    {
      "PSModulePath": "/opt/powershell/6/Modules"
    }

This example shows embedding an environment variable in a PSModulePath
configuration. Note that using the HOME environment variable and the /
directory separator, this syntax works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

    {
      "PSModulePath": "%HOME%/Documents/PowerShell/Modules"
    }

This example uses an environment variable that only works on macOS and
Linux:

    {
      "PSModulePath": "%XDG_CONFIG_HOME%/powershell/Modules"
    }

  [!NOTE] PowerShell variables can't be embedded in PSModulePath
  configurations. PSModulePath configurations on Linux and macOS are
  case-sensitive. A PSModulePath configuration must use valid directory
  separators for the platform. On macOS and Linux, this means /. On
  Windows, both / and \ work.

ScriptBlockLogging

This setting controls logging of all PowerShell script input. This setting
contains two subkeys:

-   EnableScriptBlockLogging - If you enable this policy setting,
    PowerShell logs the processing of commands, script blocks, functions,
    and scripts whether invoked interactively, or through automation.
-   EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging - enables logging of script block
    start and stop events.

Example:

    "ScriptBlockLogging": {
      "EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging": true,
      "EnableScriptBlockLogging": false
    }

Transcription

This policy setting lets you capture the input and output of PowerShell
commands in text-based transcripts. If you enable this policy setting,
PowerShell enables transcription for all PowerShell sessions.

This setting controls how transcription works in PowerShell. This setting
contains three subkeys:

-   EnableTranscripting - When this setting is enabled, PowerShell creates
    transcription log files in the configured location.
-   EnableInvocationHeader - By default, PowerShell includes a header at
    the top of the transcription log file. You can disable the header using
    this setting.
-   OutputDirectory - This setting allows you to collect transcription log
    files in a central location instead of the default location.

Example:

    {
        "Transcription": {
            "EnableTranscripting": true,
            "EnableInvocationHeader": true,
            "OutputDirectory": "c:\\tmp"
          }
    }

For more information, see Start-Transcript.

UpdatableHelp

This policy setting allows you to set the default value of the SOURCEPATH
parameter on the Update-Help cmdlet. This default value can be overridden
by specifying a different value using the SOURCEPATH parameter.

Example:

    {
        "UpdatableHelp": {
          "DefaultSourcePath": "f:\\temp"
        }
    }
