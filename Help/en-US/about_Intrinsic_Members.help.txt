ABOUT INTRINSIC MEMBERS


Short description

Provides information about PowerShell's intrinsic members that are
available to all PowerShell objects.


Detailed description

When objects are created, PowerShell adds some "hidden" properties and
methods to each object. These properties and methods are known as
_intrinsic members_. These intrinsic members are normally hidden from view.
These hidden members can be seen using the FORCE parameter of Get-Member.


Object views

The intrinsic members include a set of MEMBERSET properties that represent
a view of the object. For more information about MEMBERSET properties, see
PSMemberSet.

Every PowerShell object includes the following properties.

-   psbase

    The psbase MEMBERSET contains the members of the base object without
    extension or adaptation. Depending on the object type it's either a
    .NET instance wrapped by a [psobject] instance or, if there's no
    wrapper, it's the input object itself.

-   psadapted

    The psadapted MEMBERSET shows the base object plus the adapted members,
    if present. Adapted members are added by the Extended Type System
    (ETS).

-   psextended

    The psextended MEMBERSET _only_ shows the members added by the
    Types.ps1xml files and the Add-Member cmdlet. Any object can be
    extended at runtime using the Add-Member cmdlet.

-   psobject

    The psobject MEMBERSET a rich source of reflection for any object that
    includes methods, properties, and other information about the object.

Examples

For this example, $hash is a hashtable containing information about a user.
The FORCE parameter of Get-Member shows us the intrinsic members of the
object.

    $hash = @{
        Age  = 33
        Name = 'Bob'
    }

    $hash | Get-Member -Force -MemberType MemberSet, CodeProperty

       TypeName: System.Collections.Hashtable

    Name        MemberType   Definition
    ----        ----------   ----------
    pstypenames CodeProperty System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection`1[[System.String, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=7…
    psadapted   MemberSet    psadapted {Item, IsReadOnly, IsFixedSize, IsSynchronized, Keys, Values, SyncRoot, Count, Add,…
    psbase      MemberSet    psbase {Item, IsReadOnly, IsFixedSize, IsSynchronized, Keys, Values, SyncRoot, Count, Add, Cl…
    psextended  MemberSet    psextended {}
    psobject    MemberSet    psobject {Members, Properties, Methods, ImmediateBaseObject, BaseObject, TypeNames, get_Membe…

Using psobject is similar to using Get-Member, but provides more
flexibility. For example, you can enumerate the properties of an object and
their values.

    $hash.psobject.Properties | Select-Object Name, MemberType, Value

    Name           MemberType                    Value
    ----           ----------                    -----
    IsReadOnly       Property                    False
    IsFixedSize      Property                    False
    IsSynchronized   Property                    False
    Keys             Property              {Age, Name}
    Values           Property                {33, Bob}
    SyncRoot         Property {[Age, 33], [Name, Bob]}
    Count            Property                        2

Compare that to the object created by converting the hashtable to a
PSCUSTOMOBJECT.

    $user = [pscustomobject]$hash
    $user.psobject.Properties | Select-Object Name, MemberType, Value

    Name   MemberType Value
    ----   ---------- -----
    Age  NoteProperty    33
    Name NoteProperty   Bob

Notice that the keys from the hashtable have been converted to properties
in the PSCUSTOMOBJECT. The new properties are now part of the psextended
MEMBERSET.

    $user | Get-Member -Force -MemberType MemberSet, CodeProperty

       TypeName: System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject

    Name        MemberType   Definition
    ----        ----------   ----------
    pstypenames CodeProperty System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection`1[[System.String, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=7…
    psadapted   MemberSet    psadapted {ToString, GetType, Equals, GetHashCode}
    psbase      MemberSet    psbase {ToString, GetType, Equals, GetHashCode}
    psextended  MemberSet    psextended {Age, Name}
    psobject    MemberSet    psobject {Members, Properties, Methods, ImmediateBaseObject, BaseObject, TypeNames, get_Membe…


Type information

The pstypenames CODEPROPERTY lists the object type hierarchy in order of
inheritance. For example:

    $file = Get-Item C:\temp\test.txt
    $file.pstypenames

    System.IO.FileInfo
    System.IO.FileSystemInfo
    System.MarshalByRefObject
    System.Object

The Output starts with the most specific object type, System.IO.FileInfo,
and continues down to the most generic type, System.Object.


Methods

PowerShell adds two hidden methods to all PowerShell objects. These methods
are not visible using the Get-Member -Force command or tab completion.

ForEach() and Where()

The ForEach() and Where() methods are available to all PowerShell objects.
However, they're most useful when working with collections. For more
information on how to use these methods, see about_Arrays.


Properties

Not all scalar type have COUNT or LENGTH properties in the base type.
PowerShell adds the missing property as an intrinsic member for all scalar
types.

  [!NOTE] Uninitialized variables are implicitly $null. $null is scalar and
  has an intrinsic COUNT and LENGTH of 0.

While the COUNT and LENGTH properties are similar, they may work
differently depending on the data type. For example, the LENGTH of a string
is the number of characters in the string. The COUNT property is the number
of instances of the object.

    PS> $str = 'string'
    PS> $str.Length
    6
    PS> $str.Count
    1

For more information about these properties, see about_Properties.


Array indexing scalar types

When an object isn't an indexed collection, using the index operator to
access the first element returns the object itself. Index values beyond the
first element return $null.

    PS> (2)[0]
    2
    PS> (2)[-1]
    2
    PS> (2)[1] -eq $null
    True
    PS> (2)[0,0] -eq $null
    True

For more information, see about_Operators.


New() method for types

Beginning in PowerShell 5.0, PowerShell adds a static New() method for all
.NET types. The following examples produce the same result.

    $expression = New-Object -TypeName regex -ArgumentList 'pattern'
    $expression = [regex]::new('pattern')

Using the new() method performs better than using New-Object.
