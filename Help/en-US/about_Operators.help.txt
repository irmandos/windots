ABOUT_OPERATORS


Short description

Describes the operators that are supported by PowerShell.


Long description

An operator is a language element that you can use in a command or
expression. PowerShell supports several types of operators to help you
manipulate values.


Arithmetic Operators

Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) to calculate values in a command
or expression. With these operators, you can add, subtract, multiply, or
divide values, and calculate the remainder (modulus) of a division
operation.

The addition operator concatenates elements. The multiplication operator
returns the specified number of copies of each element. You can use
arithmetic operators on any .NET type that implements them, such as: Int,
String, DateTime, Hashtable, and Arrays.

Bitwise operators (-band, -bor, -bxor, -bnot, -shl, -shr) manipulate the
bit patterns in values.

For more information, see about_Arithmetic_Operators.


Assignment Operators

Use assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) to assign, change, or
append values to variables. You can combine arithmetic operators with
assignment to assign the result of the arithmetic operation to a variable.

For more information, see about_Assignment_Operators.


Comparison Operators

Use comparison operators (-eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -le, -ge) to compare values
and test conditions. For example, you can compare two string values to
determine whether they're equal.

The comparison operators also include operators that find or replace
patterns in text. The (-match, -notmatch, -replace) operators use regular
expressions, and (-like, -notlike) use wildcards *.

Containment comparison operators determine whether a test value appears in
a reference set (-in, -notin, -contains, -notcontains).

Type comparison operators (-is, -isnot) determine whether an object is of a
given type.

For more information, see about_Comparison_Operators.


Logical Operators

Use logical operators (-and, -or, -xor, -not, !) to connect conditional
statements into a single complex conditional. For example, you can use a
logical -and operator to create an object filter with two different
conditions.

For more information, see about_Logical_Operators.


Redirection Operators

Use redirection operators (>, >>, 2>, 2>>, and 2>&1) to send the output of
a command or expression to a text file. The redirection operators work like
the Out-File cmdlet (without parameters) but they also let you redirect
error output to specified files. You can also use the Tee-Object cmdlet to
redirect output.

For more information, see about_Redirection


Split and Join Operators

The -split and -join operators divide and combine substrings. The -split
operator splits a string into substrings. The -join operator concatenates
multiple strings into a single string.

For more information, see about_Split and about_Join.


Type Operators

Use the type operators (-is, -isnot, -as) to find or change the .NET type
of an object.

For more information, see about_Type_Operators.


Unary Operators

Use the unary ++ and -- operators to increment or decrement values and -
for negation. For example, to increment the variable $a from 9 to 10, you
type $a++.

For more information, see about_Arithmetic_Operators.


Special Operators

Special operators have specific use-cases that don't fit into any other
operator group. For example, special operators allow you to run commands,
change a value's data type, or retrieve elements from an array.

Grouping operator ( )

As in other languages, (...) serves to override operator precedence in
expressions. For example: (1 + 2) / 3

However, in PowerShell, there are additional behaviors.

Grouping result expressions

(...) allows you to let output from a _command_ participate in an
expression. For example:

    PS> (Get-Item *.txt).Count -gt 10
    True

Piping grouped expressions

When used as the first segment of a pipeline, wrapping a command or
expression in parentheses invariably causes _enumeration_ of the expression
result. If the parentheses wrap a _command_, it's run to completion with
all output _collected in memory_ before the results are sent through the
pipeline.

Grouping an expression before piping also ensures that subsequent
object-by-object processing can't interfere with the enumeration the
command uses to produce its output.

Grouping assignment statements

Ungrouped assignment statements don't output values. When grouping an
assignment statement, the value of the assigned variable is _passed
through_ and can be used in larger expressions. For example:

    PS> ($var = 1 + 2)
    3
    PS> ($var = 1 + 2) -eq 3
    True

Wrapping the statement in parentheses turns it into an expression that
outputs the value of $var.

This behavior applies to all the assignment operators, including compound
operators like +=, and the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
However, the order of operation for increment and decrement depends on
their position.

    PS> $i = 0
    PS> (++$i) # prefix
    1
    PS> $i = 0
    PS> ($i++) # postfix
    0
    PS> $i
    1

In the prefix case, the value of $i is incremented before being output. In
the postfix case, the value of $i is incremented after being output.

You can also use this technique In the context of a conditional statement,
such as the if statement.

    if ($textFiles = Get-ChildItem *.txt) {
        $textFiles.Count
    }

In this example, if no files match, the Get-ChildItem command returns
nothing and assigns nothing to $textFiles, which is considered $false in a
boolean context. If one or more FILEINFO objects are assigned to
$textFiles, the conditional evaluates to $true. You can work with the value
of $textFiles in the body of the if statement.

  [!NOTE] While this technique is convenient and concise, it can lead to
  confusion between the assignment operator (=) and the equality-comparison
  operator (-eq).

Subexpression operator $( )

Returns the result of one or more statements. For a single result, returns
a scalar. For multiple results, returns an array. Use this when you want to
use an expression within another expression. For example, to embed the
results of command in a string expression.

    PS> "Today is $(Get-Date)"
    Today is 12/02/2019 13:15:20

    PS> "Folder list: $((dir c:\ -dir).Name -join ', ')"
    Folder list: Program Files, Program Files (x86), Users, Windows

Array subexpression operator @( )

Returns the result of one or more statements as an array. The result is
always an array of 0 or more objects.

    PS> $list = @(Get-Process | Select-Object -First 10; Get-Service | Select-Object -First 10 )
    PS> $list.GetType()

    IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
    -------- -------- ----                                     --------
    True     True     Object[]                                 System.Array

    PS> $list.Count
    20
    PS> $list = @(Get-Service | Where-Object Status -eq Starting )
    PS> $list.GetType()

    IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
    -------- -------- ----                                     --------
    True     True     Object[]                                 System.Array

    PS> $list.Count
    0

Hash table literal syntax @{}

Similar to the array subexpression, this syntax is used to declare a hash
table. For more information, see about_Hash_Tables.

Call operator &

Runs a command, script, or script block. The call operator, also known as
the _invocation operator_, lets you run commands that are stored in
variables and represented by strings or script blocks. The call operator
executes in a child scope. For more about scopes, see about_Scopes. You can
use this to build strings containing the command, parameters, and arguments
you need, and then invoke the string as if it were a command. The strings
that you create must follow the same parsing rules as a command that you
type at the command line. For more information, see about_Parsing.

This example stores a command in a string and executes it using the call
operator.

    PS> $c = "Get-ExecutionPolicy"
    PS> $c
    Get-ExecutionPolicy
    PS> & $c
    AllSigned

The call operator doesn't parse strings. This means that you can't use
command parameters within a string when you use the call operator.

    PS> $c = "Get-Service -Name Spooler"
    PS> $c
    Get-Service -Name Spooler
    PS> & $c
    & : The term 'Get-Service -Name Spooler' is not recognized as the name of a
    cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of
    the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and
    try again.

The Invoke-Expression cmdlet can execute code that causes parsing errors
when using the call operator.

    PS> & "1+1"
    &: The term '1+1' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script
    file, or executable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was
    included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

    PS> Invoke-Expression "1+1"
    2

You can execute a script using its filename. A script file must have a .ps1
file extension to be executable. Files that have spaces in their path must
be enclosed in quotes. If you try to execute the quoted path, PowerShell
displays the contents of the quoted string instead of running the script.
The call operator allows you to execute the contents of the string
containing the filename.

    PS C:\Scripts> Get-ChildItem

        Directory: C:\Scripts


    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                -------------         ------ ----
    -a----        8/28/2018   1:36 PM             58 script name with spaces.ps1

    PS C:\Scripts> ".\script name with spaces.ps1"
    .\script name with spaces.ps1
    PS C:\Scripts> & ".\script name with spaces.ps1"
    Hello World!

For more about script blocks, see about_Script_Blocks.

Background operator &

Runs the pipeline before it in the background, in a PowerShell job. This
operator acts similarly to the UNIX control operator ampersand (&), which
runs the command before it asynchronously in subshell as a job.

This operator is functionally equivalent to Start-Job. By default, the
background operator starts the jobs in the current working directory of the
caller that started the parallel tasks. The following example demonstrates
basic usage of the background job operator.

    Get-Process -Name pwsh &

That command is functionally equivalent to the following usage of
Start-Job:

    Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process -Name pwsh}

Just like Start-Job, the & background operator returns a Job object. This
object can be used with Receive-Job and Remove-Job, just as if you had used
Start-Job to start the job.

    $job = Get-Process -Name pwsh &
    Receive-Job $job -Wait


     NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
     ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
          0     0.00     221.16      25.90    6988 988 pwsh
          0     0.00     140.12      29.87   14845 845 pwsh
          0     0.00      85.51       0.91   19639 988 pwsh

    Remove-Job $job

The & background operator is also a statement terminator, just like the
UNIX control operator ampersand (&). This allows you to invoke additional
commands after the & background operator. The following example
demonstrates the invocation of additional commands after the & background
operator.

    $job = Get-Process -Name pwsh & Receive-Job $job -Wait


     NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
     ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
          0     0.00     221.16      25.90    6988 988 pwsh
          0     0.00     140.12      29.87   14845 845 pwsh
          0     0.00      85.51       0.91   19639 988 pwsh

This is equivalent to the following script:

    $job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process -Name pwsh}
    Receive-Job $job -Wait

If you want to run multiple commands, each in their own background process
but all on one line, simply place & between and after each of the commands.

    Get-Process -Name pwsh & Get-Service -Name BITS & Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem &

For more information on PowerShell jobs, see about_Jobs.

Cast operator [ ]

Converts or limits objects to the specified type. If the objects can't be
converted, PowerShell generates an error.

    [DateTime] '2/20/88' - [DateTime] '1/20/88' -eq [TimeSpan] '31'

A cast can also be performed when a variable is assigned to using cast
notation.

Comma operator ,

As a binary operator, the comma creates an array or appends to the array
being created. In expression mode, as a unary operator, the comma creates
an array with just one member. Place the comma before the member.

    $myArray = 1,2,3
    $SingleArray = ,1
    Write-Output (,1)

Since Write-Output expects an argument, you must put the expression in
parentheses.

Dot sourcing operator .

Runs a script in the current scope so that any functions, aliases, and
variables that the script creates are added to the current scope,
overriding existing ones. Parameters declared by the script become
variables. Parameters for which no value has been given become variables
with no value. However, the automatic variable $args is preserved.

    . c:\scripts\sample.ps1 1 2 -Also:3

  [!NOTE] The dot sourcing operator is followed by a space. Use the space
  to distinguish the dot from the dot (.) symbol that represents the
  current directory.

  In the following example, the Sample.ps1 script in the current directory
  is run in the current scope.

      . .\sample.ps1

Format operator -f

Provide access to the .NET composite formatting feature. A composite format
string consists of fixed text intermixed with indexed placeholders, called
_format items_. These format items correspond to the objects in the list.

Each format item takes the following form and consists of the following
components:

{index[,alignment][:formatString]}

The matching braces ({ and }) are required.

The formatting operation yields a result string that consists of the
original fixed text intermixed with the string representation of the
objects in the list. For more information, see Composite Formatting.

Enter the composite format string on the left side of the operator and the
objects to be formatted on the right side of the operator.

    "{0} {1,-10} {2:N}" -f 1,"hello",[math]::pi

    1 hello      3.14

You can zero-pad a numeric value with the "0" custom specifier. The number
of zeroes following the : indicates the maximum width to pad the formatted
string to.

    "{0:00} {1:000} {2:000000}" -f 7, 24, 365

    07 024 000365

If you need to keep the curly braces ({}) in the formatted string, you can
escape them by doubling the curly braces.

    "{0} vs. {{0}}" -f 'foo'

    foo vs. {0}

Index operator [ ]

Selects objects from indexed collections, such as arrays and hash tables.
Array indexes are zero-based, so the first object is indexed as [0]. You
can also use negative indexes to get the last values. Hash tables are
indexed by key value.

Given a list of indices, the index operator returns a list of members
corresponding to those indices.

    PS> $a = 1, 2, 3
    PS> $a[0]
    1
    PS> $a[-1]
    3
    PS> $a[2, 1, 0]
    3
    2
    1

    (Get-HotFix | Sort-Object installedOn)[-1]

    $h = @{key="value"; name="PowerShell"; version="2.0"}
    $h["name"]

    PowerShell

    $x = [xml]"<doc><intro>Once upon a time...</intro></doc>"
    $x["doc"]

    intro
    -----
    Once upon a time...

When an object isn't an indexed collection, using the index operator to
access the first element returns the object itself. Index values beyond the
first element return $null.

    PS> (2)[0]
    2
    PS> (2)[-1]
    2
    PS> (2)[1] -eq $null
    True
    PS> (2)[0,0] -eq $null
    True

Pipeline operator |

Sends ("pipes") the output of the command that precedes it to the command
that follows it. When the output includes more than one object (a
"collection"), the pipeline operator sends the objects one at a time.

    Get-Process | Get-Member
    Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.StartType -eq 'Automatic'}

Pipeline chain operators && and ||

Conditionally execute the right-hand side pipeline based on the success of
the left-hand side pipeline.

    # If Get-Process successfully finds a process called notepad,
    # Stop-Process -Name notepad is called
    Get-Process notepad && Stop-Process -Name notepad

    # If npm install fails, the node_modules directory is removed
    npm install || Remove-Item -Recurse ./node_modules

For more information, see About_Pipeline_Chain_Operators.

Range operator ..

The range operator can be used to represent an array of sequential integers
or characters. The values joined by the range operator define the start and
end values of the range.

  [!NOTE] Support for character ranges was added in PowerShell 6.

Number ranges

    1..10
    $max = 10
    foreach ($a in 1..$max) {Write-Host $a}

You can also create ranges in reverse order.

    10..1
    5..-5 | ForEach-Object {Write-Output $_}

The start and end values of the range can be any pair of expressions that
evaluate to an integer or a character. The endpoints of the range must be
convertible to signed 32-bit integers ([int32]). Larger values cause an
error. Also, if the range is captured in an array, the size of resulting
array is limited to [int]::MaxValue - 56. This is maximum size of an array
in .NET.

For example, you could use the members of an enumeration for your start and
end values.

    PS> enum Food {
          Apple
          Banana = 3
          Kiwi = 10
        }
    PS> [Food]::Apple..[Food]::Kiwi
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10

  [!IMPORTANT] The resulting range isn't limited to the values of the
  enumeration. Instead it represents the range of values between the two
  values provided. You can't use the range operator to reliably represent
  the members of an enumeration.

Character ranges

To create a range of characters, enclose the characters in quotes.

    PS> 'a'..'f'
    a
    b
    c
    d
    e
    f

    PS> 'F'..'A'
    F
    E
    D
    C
    B
    A

If you assign a character range to a string, it's treated the same
assigning a character array to a string.

    PS> [string]$s = 'a'..'e'
    $s
    a b c d e
    $a = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
    $a
    a b c d e

The characters in the array are joined into a string. The characters are
separated by the value of the $OFS preference variable. For more
information, see about_Preference_Variables.

The order of the characters in the array is determined by the ASCII value
of the character. For example, the ASCII values of c and X are 99 and 88,
respectively. That range would be presented in reverse order.

    PS> 'c'..'X'
    c
    b
    a
    `
    _
    ^
    ]
    \
    [
    Z
    Y
    X

Member-access operator .

Accesses the properties and methods of an object. The member name may be an
expression.

    $myProcess.peakWorkingSet
    (Get-Process PowerShell).Kill()
    'OS', 'Platform' | Foreach-Object { $PSVersionTable. $_ }

Starting PowerShell 3.0, when you use the operator on a list collection
object that doesn't have the member, PowerShell automatically enumerates
the items in that collection and uses the operator on each of them. For
more information, see about_Member-Access_Enumeration.

Static member operator ::

Calls the static properties and methods of a .NET class. To find the static
properties and methods of an object, use the Static parameter of the
Get-Member cmdlet. The member name may be an expression.

    [datetime]::Now
    'MinValue', 'MaxValue' | Foreach-Object { [int]:: $_ }

Ternary operator ? <if-true> : <if-false>

You can use the ternary operator as a replacement for the if-else statement
in simple conditional cases.

For more information, see about_If.

Null-coalescing operator ??

The null-coalescing operator ?? returns the value of its left-hand operand
if it isn't null. Otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and
returns its result. The ?? operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand
if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

    $x = $null
    $x ?? 100

    100

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated.

    [string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
    $todaysDate ?? (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()

    1/10/2020

Null-coalescing assignment operator ??=

The null-coalescing assignment operator ??= assigns the value of its
right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand
evaluates to null. The ??= operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand
if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

    $x = $null
    $x ??= 100
    $x

    100

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated.

    [string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
    $todaysDate ??= (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()
    $todaysDate

    1/10/2020

Null-conditional operators ?. and ?[]

  [!NOTE] This feature was moved from experimental to mainstream in
  PowerShell 7.1.

A null-conditional operator applies a member access, ?., or element access,
?[], operation to its operand only if that operand evaluates to non-null;
otherwise, it returns null.

Since PowerShell allows ? to be part of the variable name, formal
specification of the variable name is required for using these operators.
You must use braces ({}) around the variable names like ${a} or when ? is
part of the variable name ${a?}.

  [!NOTE] The variable name syntax of ${<name>} shouldn't be confused with
  the $() subexpression operator. For more information, see Variable name
  section of about_Variables.

In the following example, the value of PROPNAME is returned.

    $a = @{ PropName = 100 }
    ${a}?.PropName

    100

The following example returns null without trying to access the member name
PROPNAME.

    $a = $null
    ${a}?.PropName

In this example, the value of the indexed element is returned.

    $a = 1..10
    ${a}?[0]

    1

The following example returns null without trying to access indexed
element.

    $a = $null
    ${a}?[0]
