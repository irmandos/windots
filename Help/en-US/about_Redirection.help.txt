Short description

Explains how to redirect output from PowerShell to text files.


Long description

By default, PowerShell sends output to the PowerShell host. Usually this is
the console application. However, you can redirect the output to a text
file and you can redirect error output to the regular output stream.

You can use the following methods to redirect output:

-   Use the Out-File cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file.
    Typically, you use the Out-File cmdlet when you need to use its
    parameters, such as the Encoding, Force, Width, or NoClobber
    parameters.

-   Use the Tee-Object cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file
    and then sends it to the pipeline.

-   Use the PowerShell redirection operators. Redirecting the output of a
    PowerShell command (cmdlet, function, script) using the redirection
    operator (>) is functionally equivalent to piping to Out-File with no
    extra parameters. PowerShell 7.4 changed the behavior of the
    redirection operator when used to redirect the STDOUT stream of a
    native command.

For more information about streams, see about_Output_Streams.


Redirectable output streams

PowerShell supports redirection of the following output streams.

  Stream #   Description          Introduced in    Write Cmdlet
  ---------- -------------------- ---------------- -------------------------------
  1          SUCCESS Stream       PowerShell 2.0   Write-Output
  2          ERROR Stream         PowerShell 2.0   Write-Error
  3          WARNING Stream       PowerShell 3.0   Write-Warning
  4          VERBOSE Stream       PowerShell 3.0   Write-Verbose
  5          DEBUG Stream         PowerShell 3.0   Write-Debug
  6          INFORMATION Stream   PowerShell 5.0   Write-Information, Write-Host
  *          All Streams          PowerShell 3.0   

There is also a PROGRESS stream in PowerShell, but it doesn't support
redirection.

  [!IMPORTANT] The SUCCESS and ERROR streams are similar to the stdout and
  stderr streams of other shells. However, stdin isn't connected to the
  PowerShell pipeline for input.


PowerShell redirection operators

The PowerShell redirection operators are as follows, where n represents the
stream number. The SUCCESS stream ( 1 ) is the default if no stream is
specified.

  Operator   Description                                               Syntax
  ---------- --------------------------------------------------------- --------
  >          Send specified stream to a file.                          n>
  >>         APPEND specified stream to a file.                        n>>
  >&1        _Redirects_ the specified stream to the SUCCESS stream.   n>&1

  [!NOTE] Unlike some Unix shells, you can only redirect other streams to
  the SUCCESS stream.


Redirecting output from native commands

PowerShell 7.4 changed the behavior of the redirection operators when used
to redirect the STDOUT stream of a native command. The redirection
operators now preserve the byte-stream data when redirecting output from a
native command. PowerShell doesn't interpret the redirected data or add any
additional formatting. For more information, see Example #7.


Examples

Example 1: Redirect errors and output to a file

This example runs dir on one item that succeeds, and one that fails.

    dir C:\, fakepath 2>&1 > .\dir.log

It uses 2>&1 to redirect the ERROR stream to the SUCCESS stream, and > to
send the resultant SUCCESS stream to a file called dir.log

Example 2: Send all Success stream data to a file

This example sends all SUCCESS stream data to a file called script.log.

    .\script.ps1 > script.log

Example 3: Send Success, Warning, and Error streams to a file

This example shows how you can combine redirection operators to achieve a
desired result.

    &{
       Write-Warning "hello"
       Write-Error "hello"
       Write-Output "hi"
    } 3>&1 2>&1 > C:\Temp\redirection.log

-   3>&1 redirects the WARNING stream to the SUCCESS stream.
-   2>&1 redirects the ERROR stream to the SUCCESS stream (which also now
    includes all WARNING stream data)
-   > redirects the SUCCESS stream (which now contains both WARNING and
    ERROR streams) to a file called C:\temp\redirection.log.

Example 4: Redirect all streams to a file

This example sends all streams output from a script called script.ps1 to a
file called script.log.

    .\script.ps1 *> script.log

Example 5: Suppress all Write-Host and Information stream data

This example suppresses all information stream data. To read more about
INFORMATION stream cmdlets, see Write-Host and Write-Information

    &{
       Write-Host "Hello"
       Write-Information "Hello" -InformationAction Continue
    } 6> $null

Example 6: Show the effect of Action Preferences

Action Preference variables and parameters can change what gets written to
a particular stream. The script in this example shows how the value of
$ErrorActionPreference affects what gets written to the ERROR stream.

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
    $ErrorActionPreference > log.txt
    Get-Item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
    $ErrorActionPreference >> log.txt
    Get-Item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
    $ErrorActionPreference >> log.txt
    Try {
        Get-Item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt
    }
    catch {
        "`tError caught!" >> log.txt
    }
    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Ignore'
    $ErrorActionPreference >> log.txt
    Get-Item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Inquire'
    $ErrorActionPreference >> log.txt
    Get-Item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'

When we run this script we get prompted when $ErrorActionPreference is set
to Inquire.

    PS C:\temp> .\test.ps1

    Confirm
    Can't find path 'C:\not-here' because it doesn't exist.
    [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): H
    Get-Item: C:\temp\test.ps1:23
    Line |
      23 |  get-item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt
         |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         | The running command stopped because the user selected the Stop option.

When we examine the log file we see the following:

    PS C:\temp> Get-Content .\log.txt
    Continue

    Get-Item: C:\temp\test.ps1:3
    Line |
       3 |  get-item /not-here 2>&1 >> log.txt
         |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         | Cannot find path 'C:\not-here' because it does not exist.

    SilentlyContinue
    Stop
        Error caught!
    Ignore
    Inquire

Example 7: Redirecting binary data from a native command

Beginning in PowerShell 7.4, PowerShell preserves the byte-stream data when
redirecting the STDOUT stream of a native command to a file or when piping
byte-stream data to the STDIN stream of a native command.

For example, using the native command curl you can download a binary file
and save it to disk using redirection.

    $uri = 'https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.3.7/powershell-7.3.7-linux-arm64.tar.gz'

    # native command redirected to a file
    curl -s -L $uri > powershell.tar.gz

You can also pipe the byte-stream data to the STDIN stream of another
native command. The following example downloads a zipped TAR file using
curl. The downloaded file data is streamed to the tar command to extract
the contents of the archive.

    # native command output piped to a native command
    curl -s -L $uri | tar -xzvf - -C .

You can also pipe the byte-stream output of a PowerShell command to the
input of native command. The following examples use Invoke-WebRequest to
download the same TAR file as the previous example.

    # byte stream piped to a native command
    (Invoke-WebRequest $uri).Content | tar -xzvf - -C .

    # bytes piped to a native command (all at once as byte[])
    ,(Invoke-WebRequest $uri).Content | tar -xzvf - -C .

This feature doesn't support byte-stream data when redirecting STDERR
output to STDOUT. When you combine the STDERR and STDOUT streams, the
combined streams are treated as string data.


Notes

The redirection operators that don't append data (> and n>) overwrite the
current contents of the specified file without warning.

However, if the file is a read-only, hidden, or system file, the
redirection FAILS. The append redirection operators (>> and n>>) don't
write to a read-only file, but they append content to a system or hidden
file.

To force the redirection of content to a read-only, hidden, or system file,
use the Out-File cmdlet with its Force parameter.

When you are writing to files, the redirection operators use UTF8NoBOM
encoding. If the file has a different encoding, the output might not be
formatted correctly. To write to files with a different encoding, use the
Out-File cmdlet with its Encoding parameter.

Width of output when writing to a file

When you are writing to a file using either Out-File or the redirection
operators, PowerShell formats table output to the file based on the width
of the console it's running within. For instance, when logging table output
to file using a command like Get-ChildItem Env:\Path > path.log on a system
where the console width is set to 80 columns, the output in the file is
truncated to 80 characters:

    Name                         Value
    ----                         -----
    Path                         C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7;C:\WINDOWS…

Considering that the console width may be set arbitrarily on systems where
your script is run, you may prefer that PowerShell format table output to
files based on a width that you specify instead.

The Out-File cmdlet provides a WIDTH parameter that allows you to set the
width you would like for table output. Rather than having to add
-Width 2000 everywhere you invoke Out-File, you can use the
$PSDefaultParameterValues variable to set this value for all usages of the
Out-File cmdlet in a script. And since the redirection operators (> and >>)
are effectively aliases for Out-File, setting the Out-File:Width parameter
for the whole script impacts the formatting width for the redirection
operators as well. Put the following command near the top of your script to
set Out-File:Width for the whole script:

    $PSDefaultParameterValues['out-file:width'] = 2000

Increasing the output width will increase memory consumption when logging
table formatted output. If you are logging a lot of tabular data to file
and you know you can get by with a smaller width, use the smaller width.

In some cases, such as Get-Service output, in order to use the extra width
you will need to pipe the output through Format-Table -AutoSize before
outputting to file.

    $PSDefaultParameterValues['out-file:width'] = 2000
    Get-Service | Format-Table -AutoSize > services.log

For more information about $PSDefaultParameterValues, see
about_Preference_Variables.

Potential confusion with comparison operators

The > operator isn't to be confused with the Greater-than comparison
operator (often denoted as > in other programming languages).

Depending on the objects being compared, the output using > can appear to
be correct (because 36 isn't greater than 42).

    PS> if (36 > 42) { "true" } else { "false" }
    false

However, a check of the local filesystem can see that a file called 42 was
written, with the contents 36.

    PS> dir

    Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                -------------         ------ ----
    ------          1/02/20  10:10 am              3 42

    PS> cat 42
    36

Attempting to use the reverse comparison < (less than), yields a system
error:

    PS> if (36 < 42) { "true" } else { "false" }
    ParserError:
    Line |
       1 |  if (36 < 42) { "true" } else { "false" }
         |         ~
         | The '<' operator is reserved for future use.

If numeric comparison is the required operation, -lt and -gt should be
used. For more information, see the -gt operator in
about_Comparison_Operators.
